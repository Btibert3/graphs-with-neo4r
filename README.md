# About this repo

Repo for exploring the new [neo4r](https://github.com/neo4j-rstats/neo4r) package for connecting to the wonderful [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graphh database from `R`.

## Project

This project will, in-part, replicate the work from [Nicole White](http://nicolewhite.github.io/neo4j-rstats/graphs-r-neo4j/#1).  I will attempt to update this a bit using some of the new tooling that has since been created, namely `neo4r` and `rtweets`.
