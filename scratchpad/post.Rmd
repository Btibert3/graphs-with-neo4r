## Setup

This post will attempt to use the new [neo4r](https://github.com/neo4j-rstats/neo4r) `R` package and update [Nicole's awesome work](http://nicolewhite.github.io/neo4j-rstats/graphs-r-neo4j/#1) using some of the newer packages out there, namely [rtweet](https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet).


## The Data Model

Nicole's data model looking something like this:

I am going to keep this model for now, but update the data we collect for this post to include the following hashtags:

- neo4j
- rstats
- r4ds



## Get the data from Twitter

First, make sure that you have `rtweet` installed.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("rtweet")
```

I won't go into the full details of getting setup with the Twitter API, but if this is your first time playing around, check out [the guide](https://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html) for help getting up and running.

My app is called `BrockTest`, so I am going to auth by loading the package and creating my token:


```{r echo=TRUE}
## load the rtweets package
library(rtweet)

## auth via web browswer using my app
token = create_token(
  app = "BrockTest",
  consumer_key = Sys.getenv("RTWEET_CONSUMER_KEY"),
  consumer_secret = Sys.getenv("RTWEET_CONSUMER_SECRET"),
  access_token = Sys.getenv("RTWEET_ACCESS_TOKEN"),
  access_secret = Sys.getenv("RTWEET_ACCESS_SECRET"))
get_token()
```


The only trick above is that I saved the following values to my `.Renviron` file located in my home (~) directory in order to avoid exposing these values. I then used interactive via the web browser method to complete the auth.

>  If you ever want to see what your R session has for environment variables set, you can use `Sys.getenv()`.

Now we simply need to query Twitter's API for tweets with the hashtags for this post.

```{r}
TAGS = "#rstats OR #r4ds OR #neo4j"
rt = search_tweets(q = TAGS,
                   n = 18000,
                   include_rts = TRUE)
```
